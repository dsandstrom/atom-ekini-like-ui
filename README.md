# Ekini Like UI - An Atom UI Theme
###### Forked from the [Proton theme](https://github.com/simko-io/proton) by [simko-io](https://github.com/simko-io).

UI Theme to match [Ekini Like](https://github.com/dsandstrom/atom-ekini-like-theme).
Simple, flat, and green.

### Notes
I forked [Proton](https://github.com/simko-io/proton)
which was forked from [Neutron](https://github.com/brentd/neutron-ui)
which was inspired by [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray).
So my thanks for the hard work to @kkga, @brend, and @simko-io.

### Todo
